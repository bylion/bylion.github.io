## Blockchain-technique behind bitcoin

### what's that?
 - "A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for "smart contracts" and other assistive technologies." --from hyperledger.org

### Key term
 - Smart contracts are simply computer programs that execute predefined actions when certain conditions within the system are met.

 - Consensus refers to a system of ensuring that parties agree to a certain state of the system as the true state.

 - Merkle Tree: aka  binary hash tree, is a data structure that is used to store hashes of the individual data in large datasets in a way to make the verification of the dataset efficient. It is an anti-tamper mechanism to ensure that the large dataset has not been changed. The word 'tree' is used to refer to a branching data structure in computer science, as seen in the image below. According to Andreas M. Antonopoulos, in the Bitcoin protocol,

"Merkle trees are used to summarize all the transactions in a block, producing an overall digital fingerprint of the entire set of transactions, providing a very efficient process to verify whether a transaction is included in a block." - Bitcoin Block Data (licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike 3.0 Unported, retrieved from Wikipedia)
