 Oct 2013, the day I land on USA.
 I felt like I was done. I am super happy and super happy. However, at the sam time, super worryrisum, about what I should do next.
 I am done with my goal and I am done with my dream, and all my friends are pround of me and my parents. As well, they are so happy about that. I got a lot of freedom to do anything I want to do. pick up girls, playing game, and my favarioyr basketball. But I was miss one thing, the new goal. I achieve the previous goal. that I want to achieve in my college life. And that is the direction and guide for me during the college life. BUt how about now? what is the -something that drive me for next coming year?
 unfunatlity, I dont know at that time. instead of living for something. I just have life going.

 Util now, four years later, end of 2017, I found something I want to do next.

 something is not "a successful goal". not living for a life that looks good to other people life. But just simply make my life better. And goal myself comphensicely.

 Not just get a job, work on it and something one slot goal. Dont get me wrong, that knid of goal is actural good. But personally, I don't have passion for that any more.


 So my goal make myself in a life that able to be indenden. like fincinal independency, career indepdencny.
 to be systematic, there should be four diamantion, like health, wealth, career,
