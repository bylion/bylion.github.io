## PERSONAL FINANCE FOR ENGINEERS

As yap, there is four key factor, health, social, wealth, career

So I would like to invest some time on wealth here.

The goal: I want the cash flow could produce value for me like the program. Also I dont want to spend a lot of time on investment. So I am not expected to get crazy high return, also the rate is not like the interest I could get from the bank saving account. 1%~20%
